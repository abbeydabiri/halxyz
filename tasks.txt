1) Parse the triggers into an appropriate structure (one day we might want to add some validation!).

2) The **Producer** should execute the various calls using the Multicall library. The triggers are all querying the balance for the same 0x000... address on multiple smart contracts.

3) We want to run our triggers in this way:

- ~~(BONUS) We want to batch all the triggers in groups of 3 or less (i.e. every multicall is made of max 3 sub-calls)~~
- We want to execute the various multicalls concurrently, but with no more than 3 go-routines running at the same time
- We want to handles errors

4) The output of every subcall will be a number. Should this number be even, the Producer will pass this output to the Consumer. In the future, we might want the conditions to be more sophisticated. 

5) The **Consumer** will save the number on a Database (you can use a mock here).
