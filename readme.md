As part of our application process, we'd like to see what you can produce by giving you a small assignment. It should take you no more than a few hours to complete the assignment, but any extra polish or features you might want to put in will not go unnoticed.

This is a homework assignment to assess your skills as a software engineer. You can complete it at your leisure, but don't loose sleep or a weekend over it. It's based on an extremely simplified scenario I encountered when writing the original version of HAL, so it will give you some idea of the kind of real-life problems you might face if you decide to join us! 

Hopefully you'll find this quite fun, too ðŸ˜‰

Please note t**he assignment must be done in Golang ^^**


### Background

Tokens (ERC20) on Ethereum can be thought of as key-value stores, where the contract address is the hash map, and every user address is an entry in the hash map with a balance associated to it. You can query the balance for a specific user for a certain contract using Etherscan, for example going to this link: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x80fB784B7eD66730e8b1DBd9820aFD29931aab03#readContract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x80fB784B7eD66730e8b1DBd9820aFD29931aab03#readContract) and using 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 as user address.
